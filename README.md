# Blood_Bank
Developed a project lood Bank in Java.
Users can register/login and can then add their ‘Blood Group’ along with other information like name, contact, email and location. Additionally, the person who requires blood of any type can ‘search’ accordingly and can contact to the one willing to donate.
I am sharing a quick demo of the same. I hope you like it.
